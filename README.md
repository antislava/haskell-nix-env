# Basic haskell nix development environment

Simple haskell development environment based on nix and make.
To be used promarily for the incremental development using cabal new-[build/repl] and ghcid.
Currently assumes vi as the main editor (but not critical).

## Features
* Simple/flexible/extensible setup (without multiple layers of nix functions)
* Allows declaring the nix shell environment completely via `default-flex.nix`, the main makefile (`./Makefile`), and the contents of the `hask-deps` directory
* Minimises set-up time and time and effort needed to add dependency overrides in a way facilitating version control and reproducibility
* Provides nix functions for generating tag file for code browsing

## Usage
* Add standard nix files for the target packages to work on. These are normally generated by `cabal2nix`. `haskell.vim` file provides a function for generarting these automatically on saving the respective hpack `package.yaml` files. Package source directories can (and probably should) be in separate directories.
* Specify target package nix files in `default-flex.nix`.
* Add haskell dependency overrides in `default-flex.nix` and, if necessary, by providing custom nix files per package in `hask-deps` folder. Use `hask-deps/Makefile` rules to generate and update these in the future.
* Customise (add or subtract) dependencies to be pulled in into development nix shell and for tagging in `default.nix` if necessary
* Run e.g. `make shell86` to enter development ghc-8.6.1 nix shell. Use `cabal new-*` or `ghci` for development.
  - `ghc-pkg-list_ghcXXX.txt` with the list of available haskell dependencies are generated on entering the shell. Add these to version control, if necessary for keeping track of the project dependencies.
* In the nix shell, run `make tags` to collect dependency sources (in `haskdeps`) and generate the tag file.
* `make` rules in `./Makefile` and `./hask-deps/Makefile` are trivial and should be customised as necessary. Also, `default-flex.nix` is meant to be heavily hacked on. These are the main configuration files for declaring the development environment.
